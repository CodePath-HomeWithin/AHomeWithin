    "description":"Dr. Flintstone entered the field of psychology ten years ago through her work in group homes for foster youth. Inspired by a desire to better serve the children with whom she worked, she returned to school to pursue a graduate degree in clinical psychology. She received a PsyD from the California Institute of Integral Studies in 2012. Dr. Herzberg's training includes work with low-income children and families at the Talkline Family Support Center and with parents and their young children (0-3) at the Infant Parent Program, as well as work with a diverse range of adult clients in various settings. She is currently in private practice in Berkeley, working with adults, adolescents, and children, and developing a specialization in complex trauma. Dr. Herzberg is also a meditation and yoga practitioner and incorporates mindfulness and body awareness into her work."
