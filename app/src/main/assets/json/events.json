    "eventDescription":"This is a group for parents of children who may be struggling with friendships. Our group is based on acceptance and tolerance. We will have get-togethers and play dates to enhance social skills, foster friendships for our children, and have fun! I have started this group because I have an energetic 8 year old, who often times feels left out by her peers due in part to her ADHD. If you have a child who may be feeling left out because of something they have little to no control over, join us! Let's help our children learn and grow together",
