# Project Description and Proposed Features:
A Home Within (ahomewithin.org) is a national organization dedicated to ensuring the emotional well being of foster children.  This organization has a website, but not a mobile application.  Our goal for the project is to build an android application that could help this meaningful cause.

The target audience for our app includes: foster parents, case workers, educators, school counselors, child welfare advocates, and parents in general.  

The basic functionality of the app will include: 
*  general home, information page
*  login, user-profile flows
*  searching through products available for purchase
*  detailed item views of those products
*  shopping cart and purchase experience
*  library of purchased/downloaded products.

More interesting features will include: 
*  watching dowloaded training videos
*  "playing" educational short quizes 
*  interactive and interesting display of "conversation cards" that facilitate difficult conversations

These features will be more appealing and entertaining if we can make them visually fun.

As time allows, we can look into advanced features, of finding pro-bono services nearby (given location), and comments/reviews for various products.


##Walkthrough of user profile related functionalities, major part of which includes creating user, logging in, password reset and editting profile
