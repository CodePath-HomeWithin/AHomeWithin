# Project Description and Proposed Features:
A Home Within (ahomewithin.org) is a national organization dedicated to ensuring the emotional well being of foster children.  This organization has a website, but not a mobile application.  Our goal for the project is to build an android application that could help this meaningful cause.

The target audience for our app includes: foster parents, case workers, educators, school counselors, child welfare advocates, and parents in general.  

The basic functionality of the app will include: 
*  general home, information page
*  login, user-profile flows
*  searching through products available for purchase
*  shopping cart and purchase experience
*  library of purchased/downloaded products.
*  view video
*  view conversation cards
*  find therapists and nearby parents on map
*  chat with people found on map
* search upcoming events near you
* view recommended books, blogs, and podcasts

# TODO -- MILESTONES

Store/Library Stream Flow:
	- looks like both video and conversation cards are in the same list
	- Library page looks exactly like Store page -- should not show BUY
	- on library page, clicking on video should go to video detail player view
	- on library page, clicking on conversation should go to conversation card view
	- better, less cluttered images

User flow:
	- If you are not logged on, don't show profile in toolbar
	- If you are logged in, show profile image
	- clicking the profile in the drawer should go to user profile page
	- After login, there is no way to get to where we need to go.  Can we please integrate the drawer here for access?
	- After purchase, it would be IDEAL to go to DETAIL PAGE of library!!!
Home Page:
	- we should reorder for demo
		- tools and training

		- near you
Maps:
	- either load users first, or stub users out in json for faster load
