# Project Description and Proposed Features:
A Home Within (ahomewithin.org) is a national organization dedicated to ensuring the emotional well being of foster children.  This organization has a website, but not a mobile application.  Our goal for the project is to build an android application that could help this meaningful cause.

The target audience for our app includes: foster parents, case workers, educators, school counselors, child welfare advocates, and parents in general.  

The basic functionality of the app will include: 
*  general home, information page
*  login, user-profile flows
*  searching through products available for purchase
*  shopping cart and purchase experience
*  library of purchased/downloaded products.
*  view video
*  view conversation cards
*  find therapists and nearby parents on map
*  chat with people found on map
* search upcoming events near you
* view recommended books, blogs, and podcasts
